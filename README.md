# Min.AI
This version of Minesweeper is based on the classic computer game. You can easily find out the details of the game from the web, for example: https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game) However, there are a few differences designed to better evaluate your agent which will become apparent as you play with and familiarize yourself with the game. In Minesweeper, you are given a board that is set up as a 2D grid of tiles. Each tile covers either: (1) a hint number ( that tells how many mines are around that tile ) or (2) a mine. Ultimately, your agentâ€™s goal is to uncover all tiles which do not contain a mine. A more concrete definition of the game is given by the following PEAS description.
